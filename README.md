Sudoku Solver ðŸ§©
Overview
This Sudoku Solver is a Java-based program that solves Sudoku puzzles using the Backtracking algorithm. It allows users to input an incomplete Sudoku puzzle, validates the input, and automatically finds a solution if one exists.

Features
âœ… Accepts 9x9 Sudoku grid input from the user
âœ… Backtracking algorithm to solve the puzzle efficiently
âœ… Validates input to ensure numbers are between 0 and 9
âœ… Prints the board before and after solving
âœ… Displays a message if no solution exists

How It Works
The user enters a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle, using 0 to represent empty spaces.

The program verifies the input and ensures all numbers are between 0 and 9.

The Backtracking algorithm attempts to fill empty cells recursively.

If a valid solution exists, the solved puzzle is displayed.

If the puzzle is unsolvable, the user is notified.

Algorithm Explanation
The Backtracking approach follows these steps:

Find an empty cell (represented as 0).

Try numbers 1 to 9 and check if placing a number is valid.

If valid, recursively proceed to the next empty cell.

If a dead-end is reached, backtrack (undo the last move) and try a different number.

The process continues until the puzzle is solved or deemed unsolvable.
